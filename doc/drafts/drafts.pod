=head2 Events

OpenquickIT needs to be able to configure, register and report events.

An event is starting, or the result, of any action related to the
management of IT. Access control is needed over infraestructure events.

Events maybe local or remote.

=head3 Local events

Local events, are those generated, from the management interface.

For example:

=over 4

=item * "Manager14 has granted permission to the user2, in resource34."

=item * "User3 has installed 3 available updates in host6."

=item * "Login failed for user1 from IP address."

=item *  etc...

=back

=head3 Remote events

Remote events, are those that are generated, outside the management interface.

For example:

=over 4

=item * "User3 as started a session, in host1"

=item * "Machine host2 has 3 available updates pending."

=item * "The weekly rotation of apache logs, completed successfully in host3."

=item * etc...

=back

=head3 Event fields

Notetaking:

Acording to old syslog, the following are default fields (and implicit
FACILITY and PRIORITY for each item):

 DATE | TIME | HOST | USER | MESSAGE

Acording to MS Windows screenshots, these values are registered:

 TYPE | DATE | TIME | SOURCE | CATEGORY | EVENTID | USER | HOST | MESSAGE

Current target for first 0.1 release (standalone version) is:

=over 4

=item * Show some local logs in a data grid

=back

For furter releases, main targets are:

=over 4

=item * Configure log level, rotation and mail alerts (v√≠a rsyslog)

=item * Configure rsyslogd service in managed servers

=item * Diferent log formats of diferent services (apache, iptables, etc)

=item * Search, reports and ACL over events
